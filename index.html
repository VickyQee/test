     <p>
      Website responsiveness has to do with how
       we can view website pages on
      different screen sizes, for desktop media
      queries are used and for mobile
      minimum and maximum width and height 
      are usually employed. as a developer
      we inspect to adjust the viewport until
       the ideal sizes are reached.
     </p>
     <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that
       suggests that design 
      and development should respond to the user’s
      behavior and environment based on screen size, 
      platform and orientation.
      The practice consists of a mix of flexible 
      grids and layouts, images 
      and an intelligent use of CSS media queries.
       As the user switches from 
      their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically 
      switch to accommodate
      for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.
